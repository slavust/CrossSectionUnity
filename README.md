# CrossSectionUnity

Author beleives that proposed algorithm performs better with non-manifold geometry. It may give acceptable results without annoying geometry fixing.
See [Dealing with non-closed surfaces in cross-section rendering](https://www.slavust.name/2020/03/dealing-with-not-closed-surfaces-in.html).

Also, see [usage demonstration video](https://youtu.be/QJXRe09cs34).
